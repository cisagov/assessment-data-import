`assessment-data-import-lambda` contains code to build an AWS Lambda function
that reads assessment data from a JSON file in an S3 bucket and imports it
into a database.

## Example ##

Building the AWS Lambda zip file:

1. `cd ~/cisagov/assessment-data-import-lambda`
1. `docker-compose down`
1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up`

## Note ##

Please note that the corresponding Docker image _must_ be rebuilt
locally if the script `build.sh` changes.  Given that rebuilding the Docker
image is very fast (due to Docker's caching) if the script has not changed, it
is a very good idea to _always_ run the `docker-compose build` step when
using this tool.
